# Dashdash BE Challenge

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your skills in problem solving and the delivery
of well structed, clean, reusable and testable code.

Note: This exercise is part of dashdash recruitment process. Please do not share it publicly.

## Exercise

Besides being a very skilled developer you also own a book store, but, unfortunatly, you have very little time to atend to it since you spend
most of your time coding.

You remember that you can use your skills to help you better manage the store,
so you decided to create a service that would help you do just that.

Consider the following items:

| Book | Name | Price
| -- | -- | -- |
| book01 | Dashdash essentials | 20€
| book02 | Dashdash for business | 15€
| book03 | Dashdash in-depth | 25€

And the following promotions:

| Promo | Description
| -- | -- |
| 2-for-1 | Offer one free book with the purchase of any 2 item
| bulk discount | Offer a 5€ price reduction for every 5 or more of the same item

Create a small `Book Service` that can:

* Accept order requests;
* Return the unit price of each item and the total price of the entire order with and without discount;

### Exercice Notes

* Returned values should be in the format '#.##`, ex: 20.00;
* You can make small changes to improve the solution if you think necessary, but the minimum requirements must be completed;
* Any dependency that your solution has must be embeded in the deliverable solution, so that it's easier for us to test it;
* Consider and justify the arquitecture of the solution, if you think something is important but it's not really fiseable to do as a small exercise you should document that. We value scalable solutions.

## Code / Delivery

* The code:
  * The code you delivered should be a working solution of the problem at hand;
  * It's up to you to decide how much time you spend with this excercise, remember this is not a thesis, but we expect a relative amount of time of around 2 hours;
  * It's also up to you to decide if adding documentation and/or tests is relevant. Favour self-documenting code;
  * We prefer that the codebase be in Java or Kotlin but you can use any language you want, also feel free to use a "vanilla" or framework based solution, just be ready to justify your choise;
* The proposed solution can be delivered as a `.zip` file by email or as a repository 
  in [github](github.com) or [bitbucket](bitbucket.org) and shared with us, you should also keep the repository private;
* The solution delivered will later be discussed with us.
